# LLM Documentation Rules

Essential guidelines for AI-generated technical documentation.

## Core Principles

**The Three Cs:**

- **Clear**: Simple language, one idea per sentence
- **Concise**: Necessary details without verbosity
- **Consistent**: Same terminology and style throughout

**User-Centered**: Focus on what users want to accomplish, provide context and examples.

## Documentation Types (Choose One)

### Tutorial (Learning)

- Step-by-step for beginners
- Use "you will learn"
- Include every step and expected outcomes

### How-to Guide (Problem-Solving)

- Goal-oriented directions
- Use imperative mood ("Click the button")
- Start with the problem, focus on what not why

### Reference (Information)

- Complete technical descriptions
- Consistent templates, scannable format
- Brief, factual descriptions

### Explanation (Understanding)

- Focus on why, not how
- Use examples to illustrate concepts
- Connect to existing knowledge

## Writing Rules

**Style:**

- Active voice, conversational but professional
- "You" to address reader
- Simple words over complex ones
- Define technical terms on first use

**Structure:**

- Sentences under 25 words
- Descriptive headings (H1 → H2 → H3, don't skip)
- Lead with most important information

**Language:**

- American English spelling
- Oxford comma
- Spell out acronyms first: "API (Application Programming Interface)"
- Numbers: spell one-nine, numerals 10+

## Formatting

**Text:**

- **Bold**: UI elements, important terms
- _Italics_: Emphasis
- `Code`: Variables, functions, files, commands

**Code Examples:**

1. Brief heading
2. Context/prerequisites
3. Clean, commented code
4. Explanation of key points
5. Expected result

## Accessibility

**Inclusive Language:**

- "primary/secondary" not "master/slave"
- "allowlist/denylist" not "whitelist/blacklist"
- "placeholder" not "dummy"

**Universal Design:**

- Gender-neutral language
- Avoid directional references ("above", "left")
- Reference sections by name

## Quality Check

- [ ] Accurate and up-to-date
- [ ] Matches chosen documentation type
- [ ] Clear for target audience
- [ ] Code examples tested
- [ ] Consistent formatting and terminology
- [ ] Accessible and inclusive

## Avoid

- Mixing documentation types in one page
- Inconsistent terminology
- Assuming too much knowledge
- Vague references
- Keyword stuffing over readability

_Break these rules only when it improves clarity for users._
