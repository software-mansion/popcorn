# Prepending to list

Lists are stored in memory as linked lists, meaning that each element in a list holds its value and points to the following element until the end of the list is reached. Therefore, prepending to a list is a fast (constant time) operation, while appending requires traversing entire list. That's why prepending an element is a common operation in Elixir and there's a syntax sugar for it: `[element | list]`

<EditorCode>
```elixir
list = [1, 2, 3]

# Try expressing it using the ++ operator
IO.inspect [0 | list], label: "List with prepended element"
```
