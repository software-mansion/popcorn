# Updating a tuple

It is possible to put an element at a particular index in a tuple with `put_elem`. Notice that `put_elem` returned a new tuple - that's because tuples, like lists, are also immutable. It means that changing a tuple is expensive - a whole new tuple has to be created in memory.

Note, however, that the elements themselves are not copied. When you update a tuple, all entries are shared between the old and the new tuple, except for the entry that has been replaced. This rule applies to most data structures in Elixir. This reduces the amount of memory allocation the language needs to perform and is only possible thanks to the immutable semantics of the language.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
tuple = {:ok, "hello"}

# Let's print the 'tuple' variable after the update - did it change?
IO.inspect put_elem(tuple, 1, "world"), label: "Updated tuple"
```
