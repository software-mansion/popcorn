# Accessing List Elements

Throughout the tutorial, we will talk a lot about the head and tail of a list. The head is the first element of a list and the tail is the remainder of the list. They can be retrieved with the functions `hd` and `tl`.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
#ðŸ’¡ Try changing the list to an empty list
IO.inspect hd([1, 2, 3]), label: "Head of the list"
IO.inspect tl([1, 2, 3]), label: "Tail of the list"
```
