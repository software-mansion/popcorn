# Introduction to Lists in Elixir

In this chapter we will learn two of the most used collection data-types in Elixir: lists and tuples. Let's start with lists.

Elixir uses square brackets to specify a list of values. Values can be of any type, so you can mix different types within one list.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
#ðŸ’¡ Try nesting another list within the list
IO.inspect [1, true, 3, "hello"], label: "List of various elements"

IO.inspect length([1, 2, 3]), label: "Length of the list"
```
