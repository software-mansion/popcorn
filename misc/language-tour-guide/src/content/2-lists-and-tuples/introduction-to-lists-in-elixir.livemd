# Introduction to Lists in Elixir

In this chapter we will learn two of the most used collection data-types in Elixir: lists and tuples. Let's start with lists.

Elixir uses square brackets to specify a list of values. Values can be of any type, so you can mix different types within one list.

A list of various elements (try nesting another list within the list):

```elixir
[1, true, 3, "hello"]
```

Getting the length of a list:

```elixir
length([1, 2, 3])
```
