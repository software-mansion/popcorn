# List Operations in Elixir

Two lists can be concatenated or subtracted using the `++` and `--` operators respectively. List operators never modify the existing list. Concatenating to or removing elements from a list returns a new list. We say that Elixir data structures are *immutable*. One advantage of immutability is that it leads to clearer code. You can freely pass the data around with the guarantee no one will mutate it in memory - only transform it.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
list = [1, 2, 3]

# Let's print the 'list' variable after concatenating. Did it change?
IO.inspect list ++ [4, 5, 6], label: "Concatenated list"

IO.inspect [1, true, 2, false, 3, true] -- [true, false], label: "Subtracted list"
```
