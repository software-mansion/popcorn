# Tuples

Elixir uses curly brackets to define tuples. Like lists, tuples can hold any value.

Tuples store elements contiguously in memory which means accessing a tuple element by index or getting the tuple size is a fast operation.

A tuple example:

```elixir
tuple = {:ok, "hello"}
```

Accessing the second element of a tuple:

```elixir
elem(tuple, 1)
```

Getting the size of a tuple:

```elixir
tuple_size(tuple)
```
