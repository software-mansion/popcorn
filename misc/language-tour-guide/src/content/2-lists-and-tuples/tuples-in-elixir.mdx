# Tuples in Elixir

Elixir uses curly brackets to define tuples. Like lists, tuples can hold any value. Tuples store elements contiguously in memory which means accessing a tuple element by index or getting the tuple size is a fast operation.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
IO.inspect {:ok, "hello"}, label: "Tuple example"
IO.inspect elem({:ok, "hello"}, 1), label: "Second element of a tuple"
IO.inspect tuple_size({:ok, "hello"}), label: "Size of the tuple"
```
