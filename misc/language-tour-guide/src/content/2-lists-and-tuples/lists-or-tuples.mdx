# Lists or tuples?

Due to their performance characteristics, lists are frequently used for storing dynamically growing, possibly large, collections.

Tuples, on the other hand, are most useful for grouping a small, fixed number of values, for example to return them from a function.

A common pattern is to use 'tagged tuples', which consist of an atom and a value, for example `{:ok, "result"}`.

```elixir
#ðŸ’¡ Let's add another word to "hello world"
IO.inspect String.split("hello world", " "), label: "String.split returns a list"

IO.inspect String.split_at("hello world", 3), label: "String.split_at returns a 2-element tuple"

#ðŸ’¡ Try changing the input so it contains an invalid character, such as 'z'
IO.inspect Base.decode16("666F6F626172"), label: "Base.decode16 returns a tagged tuple"

# Note that there's also Base.decode16! (with a trailing ! sign),
# that raises an error on invalid input instead of returning a tuple.
# It's a convention to define two versions of a function like these -
# one that returns a tagged tuple, the other that raises (marked with a
# trailing !) - for different usage scenarios.
#
#ðŸ’¡ Try changing the input so it contains an invalid character, such as 'z'
IO.inspect Base.decode16!("666F6F626172"), label: "Base.decode16! just returns result"
```
