# Accessing List Elements

Throughout the tutorial, we will talk a lot about the head and tail of a list. The head is the first element of a list and the tail is the remainder of the list. They can be retrieved with the functions `hd` and `tl`.

Head of the list (try changing the list to an empty list):

```elixir
hd([1, 2, 3])
```

Tail of the list:

```elixir
tl([1, 2, 3])
```
