# Error Handling and Charlists

When Elixir sees a list of printable ASCII numbers, it will print that as a charlist (a list of characters). That's for better interoperability with Erlang, where strings are represented as charlists instead of binaries.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
# Try appending '0' to the lists below
IO.inspect [11, 12, 13], label: "Charlist with control characters"
IO.inspect [104, 101, 108, 108, 111], label: "Charlist representing hello"
```
