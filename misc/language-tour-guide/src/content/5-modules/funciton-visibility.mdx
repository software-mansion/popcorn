# Public and Private Functions

In Elixir, functions defined with `def` are public and can be called from other modules.

Functions defined with `defp` are private and can only be called within the same module.

This is Elixir's way of controlling what's "exported" from a module.

Try changing `defp` to `def` for the private function and see what happens when you try to call it directly.

export const defaultCode = `defmodule Math do
  # Public function
  def pi do
    3.14159
  end
  
  # Private function - try changing to def
  defp secret_number do
    42
  end
  
  def calculate do
    pi() * secret_number()
  end
end

# This works

IO.puts("pi: #{Math.pi()}")
IO.puts("calculate: #{Math.calculate()}")

# This would fail if uncommented

# IO.puts(Math.secret_number())`
