# Variable scoping

This is a good opportunity to talk about variable scoping in Elixir. If any variable is declared or changed inside `if`, `case`, and similar constructs, the declaration and change will only be visible inside the construct.

In said cases, if you want to change a value, you must return the value from the `if`.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
x = 1
if true do
  x = x + 1
end

IO.inspect x, label: "x remains unchanged"

x = if true do
  x + 1
else
  x
end

IO.inspect x, label: "x is reassigned to"
```
