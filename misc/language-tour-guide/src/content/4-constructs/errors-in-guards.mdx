# Errors in guards

Errors in guards do not leak but simply make the guard fail. It makes the code simpler, as some checks can be skipped - in the example, we don't have to check if `x` is a number. However, you won't be notified about a guard failure - it just won't match.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
# Try calling "a" + 1 outside of the guard
case "a" do
  x when x + 1 == 3 -> IO.puts "Won't match"
  x -> IO.puts "Got #{x}"
end
```
