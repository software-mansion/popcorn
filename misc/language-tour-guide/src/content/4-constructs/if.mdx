# if

`case` builds on pattern matching and guards to destructure and match on certain conditions.

However, patterns and guards are limited only to certain expressions which are optimized by the compiler. In many situations, you need to write conditions that go beyond what can be expressed with `case`. For those, `if` is a useful alternative.

`if` accepts an expression, then a `do` block, and optionally an `else` block. If the expression evaluates to a truthy value (anything except `false` and `nil`), then the `do` block is evaluated. Otherwise - the `else` block, if present.

```elixir
# Try changing true to IO.puts("hello")
if true do
  IO.puts "This works!"
end

# Try changing false to nil
if false do
  IO.puts "This will never be seen"
end

if 4 > 5 do
  IO.puts "This won't be seen"
else
  IO.puts "This will"
end
```
