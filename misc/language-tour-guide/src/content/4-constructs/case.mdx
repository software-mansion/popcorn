# case

In this chapter, we will learn about the `case`, `if`, and `cond` control flow structures. Let's start with `case`.

`case` allows you to compare a value against many patterns until there is a matching one. You can use `_` as the last, catch-all pattern, that would match any value. Without it, if no pattern matches, an error is raised.

```elixir
# Try changing {1, 2, 3} to other values and see what matches!
case {1, 2, 3} do
  {4, 5, 6} ->
    IO.puts "This clause won't match"
  {1, x, 3} ->
    IO.puts "This clause will match and bind x to #{x} in this clause"
  _ ->
    IO.puts "This clause would match any value"
end

# Let's change :ok to :error. What happens?
case :ok do
  :ok -> IO.puts "ok!"
end
```
