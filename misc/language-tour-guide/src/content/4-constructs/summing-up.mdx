# Summing up

We have concluded the introduction to the most fundamental control-flow constructs in Elixir.

Generally speaking, Elixir developers prefer pattern matching and guards, using `case` and function definitions (which we will explore in future chapters), as they are succinct and precise.

When your logic cannot be outlined within patterns and guards, you may consider `if`, falling back to `cond` when there are several conditions to check.

Before you go further, let's try a little exercise.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
#ðŸ’¡ Let's try an exercise:
# Try rewriting the following code into a single `case`
# with three clauses.
# You'll need to rephrase the conditions into pattern matching.
# Then, try changing the values of `nums` and `opt`.
#
# Hint: To put two values into `case`, make them a tuple.

nums = [1, 2, 3]
opt = :a

if opt == :a do
  IO.puts("fizz")
else
  if hd(nums) == 2 do
    IO.puts("buzz")
  else
    IO.puts("bazz")
  end
end
```
