# cond

If all of the conditions in `cond` return `nil` or `false`, an error (`CondClauseError`) is raised. For this reason, it may be necessary to add a final condition, equal to `true`, which will always match.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
#ðŸ’¡ Try removing the last condition (true -> ...). What happens?
cond do
  2 + 2 == 5 ->
    IO.puts "This is never true"
  2 * 2 == 3 ->
   IO.puts "Nor this"
  true ->
    IO.puts "This is always true (equivalent to else)"
end
```
