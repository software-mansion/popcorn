# cond

We have used `case` to find a matching clauses from many patterns. We have used `if` to check for a single condition. If you need to check across several conditions and find the first one that evaluates to a truthy value, `cond` is a useful construct.

If you find yourself nesting several `if` blocks, you may want to consider using `cond` instead. `cond` is equivalent to `else if` clauses in many imperative languages - although used less frequently in Elixir.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
cond do
  2 + 2 == 5 ->
    IO.puts "This will not be true"
  2 * 2 == 3 ->
    IO.puts "Nor this"
  1 + 1 == 2 ->
    IO.puts "But this will"
end
```
