# Welcome to the Elixir Language Tour üöÄ

This guide is your first step into the world of Elixir, a modern,
functional programming language designed for building scalable
and maintainable applications.

### Navigation

You can navigate between steps using buttons below or using menu accessible with
a button below Popcorn logo in the top-left content.

### Code editor

This tour will walk you through Elixir's core concepts with interactive examples.
You can edit them, run them and the code you write is persisted.
Click "Reset code" to bring back the original code
if your experiments go a bit too far.

## Hello, Elixir!

As with every language, the first example is printing something. This is something you will often see in this guide:
`IO.puts` prints a string, while `IO.inspect` prints a representation of any value (in Elixir called `term`) and returns it.
Click "Run code" to see them in action!

After executing the code, below the editor you'll see execution time, what was printed to the standard output
and a result of the execution, which is the value returned from last expression.

export const defaultCode = `IO.puts("Hello, Elixir!")
IO.inspect(1 + 2)`;

## It runs in your browser! üçø

The code is executed inside your browser via WebAssembly, thanks to the [Popcorn project](https://popcorn.swmansion.com/).
It is still under development and has some limitations.
If you encounter any problems or have suggestions regarding the tour content, let us know by filing an issue
