# Welcome to the Elixir Language Tour üöÄ

This guide is your first step into the world of Elixir, a modern,
functional programming language designed for building scalable
and maintainable applications.

The guide is in fact an interactive version of the
[Elixir's getting started guide](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/introduction.html) by The Elixir Team ([license](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/main/LICENSE)).
For now, only a part of the guide's content is covered. We're looking forward
to your feedback - if you like it, we'll extend it further! Please use the
'give feedback' button on the top right to share your feedback.

### Navigation

You can navigate between steps using buttons below or using menu accessible with
a button below Popcorn logo in the top-left content.

### Code editor

This tour will walk you through Elixir's core concepts with interactive examples.
You can edit them, run them and the code you write is persisted.
Click "Reset code" to bring back the original code
if your experiments go a bit too far.

## Hello, Elixir!

As with every language, the first example is printing something. This is something you will often see in this guide:
`IO.puts` prints a string, while `IO.inspect` prints a representation of any value (in Elixir called "term") and returns it.
Click "Run code" to see them in action!

After executing the code, below the editor you'll see execution time, what was printed to the standard output
and a result of the execution, which is the value returned from the last expression.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
# A line that starts with # is a comment
# We'll use comments for short explanations and small excercises

IO.puts("Hello, Elixir!")
IO.inspect(1 + 2)

# You can specify a 'label' to include additional info:
IO.inspect(1 + 2, label: "Added 1 to 2")

# You can also omit braces:
IO.inspect 1 + 2, label: "Added 1 to 2"
```
</EditorCode>

## It runs in your browser! üçø

The code is executed inside your browser via WebAssembly, thanks to the [Popcorn project](https://popcorn.swmansion.com/).
It is still under development and has some limitations.
