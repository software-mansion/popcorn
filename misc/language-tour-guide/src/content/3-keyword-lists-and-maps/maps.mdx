# Maps

Apart from keyword lists, Elixir allows storing key-value pairs in maps. A map is created using the `%{}` syntax.

Compared to keyword lists, maps:
- allow any value as a key
- don't allow duplicate keys
- aren't ordered - you shouldn't rely on their internal ordering
- are faster to operate on, especially with big number of keys

```elixir
IO.inspect %{}, label: "Empty map"

IO.inspect %{1 => "a", :b => 10}, label: "Map with keys and values of different types"

IO.inspect %{1 => "a", :b => 10} == %{:b => 10, 1 => "a"}, label: "In maps, order doesn't matter"
```
