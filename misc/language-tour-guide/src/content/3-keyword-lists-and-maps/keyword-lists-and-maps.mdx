# Keyword lists and maps

Now let's talk about associative data structures. Associative data structures are able to associate a key to a certain value. Different languages call these different names like dictionaries, hashes, associative arrays, etc.

In Elixir, we have two main associative data structures: keyword lists and maps. Let's start with keyword lists.

Keyword lists are regular lists, with additional requirement: each element is a two-element tuple, where the first element is a key and the second is a value. Keys are required to be atoms, and values can be of any type.

For constructing keyword lists, we usually use a syntax sugar: `[key1: value1, key2: value2, ...]`.

```elixir
IO.inspect [{:a, 1}, {:b, 2}], label: "A keyword list"
IO.inspect [a: 1, b: 2], label: "The same keyword list"

IO.inspect [a: 1, b: 2, b: 3], label: "Keyword lists can have duplicate keys"

IO.inspect [a: 1, b: 2] != [b: 2, a: 1], label: "In keyword lists, order matters"
```
