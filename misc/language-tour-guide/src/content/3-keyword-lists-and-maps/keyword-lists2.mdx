# Keyword lists

Keyword lists are commonly used to pass options to functions.

Let's take `String.split` as an example. It takes two arguments: the string to be split, and the pattern to split on.

But it can also take the third argument: a keyword list, with two possible keys:
- `:parts` - the string is split into at most as many parts as this option specifies
- `:trim` - boolean, if true, empty strings are removed from the resulting list.

Check the example to see how it works!

<EditorCode>
```elixir
IO.inspect String.split("1 2 3 4", " "), label: "Split the string of numbers on space"

# Let's add some more spaces between 1 and 2. What's the result?
IO.inspect String.split("1 2 3 4", " ", [parts: 3]), label: "Split the string on space, at most 3 times"

# Let's add some more spaces between 1 and 2. What's the result?
# Try changing the order of parts: 3 and trim: true. Try removing any of them.
IO.inspect String.split("1 2 3 4", " ", [parts: 3, trim: true]), label: "Split the string on space, at most 3 times, and trim the result"

# If the keyword list is passed as the last argument, you can omit braces:
IO.inspect String.split("1 2 3 4", " ", parts: 3, trim: true), label: "Split the string on space, at most 3 times, and trim the result"
```
