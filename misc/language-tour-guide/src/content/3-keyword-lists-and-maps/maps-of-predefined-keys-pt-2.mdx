# Maps of predefined keys

When key is an atom, there's dedicated syntax for accessing the map: `map.key` and updating it: `%{map | key: value}`.

When a map has predefined, atom keys, it's best to use this syntax over `Map` module, because it raises when the key is not already there. Thus, if you accidentally use a wrong key, you get feedback early on, sometimes even in the compile time.

This is also the syntax used to power another Elixir feature called "Structs", which we will learn later on.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
user = %{name: "John", age: 23}

# What happens if you try to get user's surname, which is not there?
IO.inspect user.name, label: "User's name"

# Try replacing age with a non-existent key
IO.inspect %{user | age: 24}, label: "Happy birthday, John"
```
