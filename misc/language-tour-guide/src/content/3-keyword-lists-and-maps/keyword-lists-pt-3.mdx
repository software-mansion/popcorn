# Keyword lists

Keyword lists are commonly used to pass options to functions.

Actually, we're using them all the time with `IO.inspect`!

The second argument of `IO.inspect` is actually a keyword list. We only pass the `label` key, but others are possible, such as `pretty`.

It may be not obvious, because there are no square braces - we can omit them when a keyword list is the last argument of a function.

Check the example to see how it works!

<EditorCode>
```elixir
# Equivalents of IO.inspect :hello, label: "Print hello"
IO.inspect("hello", [{:label, "Print hello"}])
IO.inspect("hello", [label: "Print hello"])

#ðŸ’¡ Try removing the label, try changing order of keys
#ðŸ’¡ Try using 'printable_limit' key to limit printed characters
IO.inspect [{1, 2, 3}, "hello world"],
  label: "Print a list", pretty: true, width: 15

# String.split can also accept a keyword list
#ðŸ’¡ Try removing square braces from [parts: 3]
IO.inspect String.split("1 2 3 4", " "),
    label: "Split the string of numbers on space"
IO.inspect String.split("1 2 3 4", " ", [parts: 3]),
    label: "Split the string on space, at most 3 times"
```
