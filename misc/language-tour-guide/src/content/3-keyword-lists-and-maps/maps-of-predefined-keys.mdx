# Maps of predefined keys

In the previous section, we have used maps as a key-value data structure where keys can be added or removed at any time.

However, it is also common to create maps with a predefined set of keys. Their values may be updated, but new keys are never added nor removed.

This is useful when we know the shape of the data we are working with and, if we get a different key, it likely means a mistake was done elsewhere.

In such cases, the keys are most often atoms. Thus, there's a syntax sugar for that: `%{key1: value1, key2: value2}`.

```elixir
IO.inspect %{:name => "John", :age => 23}, label: "A map representing a user"

IO.inspect %{name: "John", age: 23}, label: "The same user"
```
