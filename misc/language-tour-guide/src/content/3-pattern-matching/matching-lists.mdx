# Matching Lists

List matching works similarly to tuples - you can extract every element of the list.
The sizes of pattern and and the value must equal for a succesful matching.

There is, however, a special pattern using the "cons" operator (`|`, see [the lists section](../data-structures/lists-basics)).
It allows matching on the first element of the list (called "head")
and the rest of the list (called "tail") similarily to the way you can build a list.

```elixir
[j, k, l] = [1, 2, 3]
IO.inspect(j, label: "j")
IO.inspect(k, label: "k")
IO.inspect(l, label: "l")

# Try to match empty (`[]`) or single element list (`[1]`)
[head | tail] = [1, 2, 3]
# [head | tail] = [1]
# [head | tail] = []
IO.inspect(head, label: "head")
IO.inspect(tail, label: "tail")

# | is used for both prepending and destructuring the list
[head | tail] = [1 | [2 | [3 | []]]]
IO.inspect(head, label: "new_head")
IO.inspect(tail, label: "new_tail")
IO.inspect([0 | tail], label: "list with new head")
```
