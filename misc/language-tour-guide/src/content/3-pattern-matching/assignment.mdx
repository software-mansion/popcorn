# Assignment and variables

Similarily to many other languages, you may define a new variable by assigning a value using `=` sign.

While the values in Elixir are immutable, you may re-assign the variable name to a different value,
even of a different type.

By convention, the variable names are written in `snake_case`

<EditorCode>

```elixir
x = "value"
IO.inspect(x, label: "x")

y = x
IO.inspect(y, label: "y")

x = :ok
IO.inspect(x, label: "new x")
IO.inspect(y, label: "y again")
```
