# Match operator

Going through this guide, you have seen the `=` operator a lot, used to assign a value to the variable.
Turns out, it's not just an assignment! `=` in Elixir is called _the match operator_.

Check out the example - after the `1` is assigned to `x`, it can be used for matching.
Line `1 = x` is legal and means "match x against pattern 1", that is successful.

Test out what happens if the pattern becomes `2` or when you try to match the variable before an assignment.
Spoiler alert - you'll see some errors. Notice the difference between them - one occurs in runtime,
while the other occurs during compilation.

```elixir
1 = 1
x = 1
1 = x
# 2 = x # What will happen?
# 2 = new_variable # What will happen?
```
