# Match operator

You've seen the `=` operator used to assign a value to the variable.
`=` in Elixir is called _the match operator_.
As it turns out, it can do much more than just a simple assignment!

Check out the example - after the `1` is assigned to `x`, it can be used for matching.
Line `1 = x` is legal and means "match x against pattern 1", which succeeds.

Test out what happens if the pattern becomes `2` or when you try to match the variable before an assignment.
Spoiler alert - you'll see some errors. Notice the difference between them - one occurs in runtime,
while the other occurs during compilation.

```elixir
1 = 1
x = 1
1 = x
# 2 = x # What will happen?
# 2 = new_variable # What will happen?
```
