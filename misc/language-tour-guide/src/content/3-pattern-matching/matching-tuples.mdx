# Matching Tuples

Thanks to pattern matching, you can "extract" each tuple element into a variable.
The pattern must be of the same size for the match to succeed.

In Elixir, it is common to return a tuple `{:ok, result}` on success and either `:error` atom
or `{:error, reason}` tuple in case of failure.
You can also use atoms in the pattern to match on such results.

```elixir
{x, y, z} = {:hello, "world", 42}
IO.inspect(x, label: "x")
IO.inspect(y, label: "y")
IO.inspect(z, label: "z")

# Uncomment to see the match error
# {a, b} = {:hello, "world", 42}

{a, b, c} = {:hello, "world", 42}
IO.inspect(a, label: "a")
IO.inspect(b, label: "b")
IO.inspect(c, label: "c")

{:ok, answer} = Map.fetch(%{answer: 42}, :answer)
IO.inspect(answer, label: "answer")
```
