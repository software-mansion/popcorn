# Receive clauses

The syntax for the `receive` block may look similar to `case`. That's because you can pass patterns to `receive` as well!

The `receive` block goes through the process' mailbox searching for the first message that matches any of the given patterns.

If there is no message in the mailbox matching any of the patterns, the current process will wait until a matching message arrives. A timeout can also be specified.

```elixir
send(self(), {:hello, "world"})

receive do
  x when is_integer(x) -> IO.inspect x, label: "This won't match"
  {:hello, addressee} -> IO.inspect addressee, label: "Received hello to"
end

# Try changing :bye to {:hello, "world"}
send(self(), :bye)

receive do
  {:hello, addressee}  -> IO.inspect addressee, label: "This won't be received"
after
  1_000 -> IO.puts "Nothing after 1s"
end
```
