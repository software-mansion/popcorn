# ðŸ’¡ Exercise: send and receive

Let's practice sending messages between processes.

Let's spawn two processes: `p1` and `p2`. Firstly, `p2` should send a `ping` message to `p1`. The message should be a tuple: `{:ping, p2_pid}`.

Then, `p1` should send back a `pong` message (just a `:pong` atom) to `p2`, using the PID it received.

Let's make the processes print messages they send and receive, like `IO.puts("Sending ping to p1")`.

Hint: start from implementing `p2`, then implement `p1`.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
p1 = spawn(fn ->
  # Receive ping message from p2
  # Use pattern matching to get the PID of p2
  # Send a pong message back to p2
end)

p2 = spawn(fn ->
  # Send a {:ping, self()} message to p1
  # Receive pong message from p1
end)

# Wait until processes finish exchanging messages
Process.sleep(100)
```
