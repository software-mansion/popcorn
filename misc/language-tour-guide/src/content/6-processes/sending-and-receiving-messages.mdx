# Sending and receiving messages

Processes get much more interesting when we are able to send and receive messages.

We can send messages to a process with `send` and receive them with `receive`.

`send` accepts the PID of the target process and a message which can be any value.

When a message is sent from a process A to a process B, it's enqueued in B's mailbox. Mailbox is a special queue that each process has.

To pop a message from the mailbox, you can use `receive do ... end`.


<EditorCode>
```elixir
# First, spawn the receiver and get its PID
receiver_pid = spawn(fn ->
  receive do
    message -> IO.inspect message, label: "Received a message"
  end
end)

# Then, send a message to the receiver
#ðŸ’¡ Try spawning another process and sending a message from there
send(receiver_pid, {:hello, "world"})

# A process can send a message to itself
send(self(), "message to self")

receive do
  message -> IO.inspect message,
              label: "Received a message from self"
end
```
