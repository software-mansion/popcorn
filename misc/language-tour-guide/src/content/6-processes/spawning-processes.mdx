# Spawning processes

The basic mechanism for spawning new processes is the auto-imported `spawn` function. 

`spawn` takes a function which it will execute in another process, and returns a PID (process identifier), that can be used to interact and communicate with the process.

After executing the function, the process exits immediately. We can check whether a process is alive with `Process.alive?` function.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
pid = spawn(fn -> 1 + 2 end)

IO.inspect pid, label: "Spawn returns a PID"

# Since the process only performed addition, it's most likely dead at this point
# Try replacing the function passed to spawn with 'fn -> Process.sleep(1000) end'.
# Is the process alive?
IO.inspect Process.alive?(pid), label: "Is the process alive?"
```
