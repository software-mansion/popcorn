# Processes - The Heart of Elixir

Processes are the fundamental unit of concurrency in Elixir. They're lightweight, isolated, and communicate through message passing.

**Important**: Elixir processes are NOT operating system processes. They're much lighter - you can spawn millions of them!

Each process:

- Has its own memory (no shared state)
- Runs concurrently with other processes
- Communicates only through messages
- Can fail without affecting other processes

export const defaultCode = `# Spawning a simple process
pid =
  spawn(fn ->
    IO.puts("Hello from process #{inspect(self())}")
  end)

IO.puts("Main process: #{inspect(self())}")
IO.puts("Spawned process: #{inspect(pid)}")

# Check if process is alive

# Give it time to finish
Process.sleep(100)
IO.puts("Is spawned process alive? #{Process.alive?(pid)}")

# Spawn a longer-running process

long_pid =
  spawn(fn ->
    IO.puts("Starting long process...")
    Process.sleep(2000)
    IO.puts("Long process done!")
  end)

IO.puts("Long process alive? #{Process.alive?(long_pid)}")
Process.sleep(100)
IO.puts("Still alive after 100ms? #{Process.alive?(long_pid)}")
`
