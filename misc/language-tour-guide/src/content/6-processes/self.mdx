# Self

All Elixir code runs in processes.

The code evaluator we use to run examples also spawns a process. We can tell that by calling `self`, which returns the PID of the current process.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
pid = self()
IO.inspect pid, label: "This code runs in a process and its PID is"
IO.inspect Process.alive?(pid), label: "Is code runner alive?"

spawn(fn ->
  IO.inspect self(), label: "This code runs in another process"
end)

# Let's run this code a few times. How do the PIDs change?
```
