# Capturing regular function

Sometimes we may want to convert a regular function to an anonymous one, for example to pass it as an argument.

We could write it as `&function(&1, &2, ...)`, but there's a shorthand for that: `&function/arity`, where 'arity' stands for the number of arguments.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
#ðŸ’¡ Try also &String.contains?/2
string_split = &String.split/2

IO.inspect string_split,
  label: "Inspecting stream_split shows what it captured"

IO.inspect is_function(string_split),
  label: "Is string_split a function?"

IO.inspect string_split.("hello world", " "),
  label: "Call to string_split returns"
```
