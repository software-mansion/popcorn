# Clauses and guards

Similar to `case/2`, we can pattern match on the arguments of anonymous functions as well as define multiple clauses and guards - see the example.

The number of arguments in each anonymous function clause needs to be the same, otherwise an error is raised.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
#ðŸ’¡ Try adding another clause with three arguments: x, y and z
f = fn
  x, y when x > 0 -> x + y
  a, b -> a * b
end

#ðŸ’¡ Let's change 1 to -1
IO.inspect f.(1, 3), label: "Call to f returns"
```
