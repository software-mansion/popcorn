# Closures

Anonymous functions can also access variables that are in scope when the function is defined.

This is typically referred to as closures, as they close over their scope.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
a = 3

increment_by_a = fn x -> x + a end

#ðŸ’¡ Try assigning 4 to variable 'a',
# after the function is defined and before it's called
# Does it affect the function?
IO.inspect increment_by_a.(2),
  label: "Call to increment_by_a returns"
```
