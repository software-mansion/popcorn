# Returning values

In many languages, there's a `return` keyword, used to return a value from a function.

In Elixir, there's no such keyword - the value returned is just the last value in the function body.

It means that each function returns something. If there's nothing sensible to return, we usually return `:ok`.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
#ðŸ’¡ Let's make inspect_and_add return :ok
inspect_and_add = fn a, b ->
  IO.inspect({a, b})
  a + b
end

IO.inspect inspect_and_add.(2, 3),
  label: "Call to inspect_and_add returns"
```
