# The capture operator

For creating short, simple functions, we can also use the capture operator `&`.

Then, we can use `&1`, `&2`, `&3` etc to refer to the first, second, third argument etc - see the example.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
# This is equivalent to fn a, b -> a + b end
add = & &1 + &2

IO.inspect add.(2, 3), label: "Call to add returns"

split_by_comma = &String.split(&1, ",")

IO.inspect split_by_comma.("1,2,3"),
  label: "Call to split_by_comma returns"
```
