# Congratulations!

You've completed the Elixir basics lesson!

You've learned about:

- Modules and functions
- Pattern matching
- Immutability
- Basic types
- The pipe operator
- Processes and OTP
- And more!

Elixir's functional programming paradigm might feel different from imperative languages, but its emphasis on immutability, pattern matching, and data transformation pipelines leads to robust and maintainable code.

export const defaultCode = `IO.puts("ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations on completing the Elixir basics!")
IO.puts("You're ready to explore more advanced topics like:")
IO.puts("  â€¢ Phoenix web framework")
IO.puts("  â€¢ LiveView for interactive UIs")
IO.puts("")
IO.puts("Happy coding with Elixir! ðŸš€")`;
