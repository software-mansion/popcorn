# Structural comparison

Elixir also provides `==`, `!=`, `<=`, `>=`, `<` and `>` as comparison operators. We can compare numbers, atoms, strings, booleans, etc. Integers and floats compare the same if they have the same value, but you can use the strict comparison operator `===` and `!==` if you want to distinguish between integers and floats.

The comparison operators in Elixir can compare across any data type. It means you can, for example, compare strings with integers. It's useful in cases like sorting algorithms, but there are caveats - you can read more about it [here](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.html#module-structural-comparison).

```elixir
IO.inspect 1 == 1, label: "is 1 equal to 1"

#ðŸ’¡ Let's change 2.0 to 1.0. Are they equal now?
IO.inspect 1 == 2.0, label: "is 1 equal to 2.0"

#ðŸ’¡ Let's change "bar" to "foo". Are the strings equal
# if they have the same contents?
IO.inspect "foo" == "bar",
  label: "is 'foo' string equal to 'bar' string"

#ðŸ’¡ Try changing '===' to '=='. Does the result change?
IO.inspect 1 === 1.0,
  label: "is 1 integer strictly equal to 1.0 float"

IO.inspect "abc" > 1, label: "is a string greater than a number?"

#ðŸ’¡ Try changing the atom name
IO.inspect :infinity > 1, label: "is an atom greater than one?"
```
