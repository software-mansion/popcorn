# Strings and binaries

Strings in Elixir are delimited by double quotes, and they are encoded in UTF-8:

A UTF-8 string:

```elixir
"Cześć"
```

You can concatenate them with `<>` operator and interpolate with `#{}`.

```elixir
"hello" <> " " <> "world"
```

Interpolation works for all types that support conversion to string:

```elixir
number = 42
"I am #{number} years old!"
```

Finally, `IO.puts/1` prints a string to the standard output:

```elixir
IO.puts("hello world")
```

Let's dive deeper into how strings are represented internally.

## Strings as Binaries

Strings in Elixir are represented internally by contiguous sequences of bytes, known as binaries. Thus, we can use functions such as `byte_size` on strings. Functions specific to strings are in the `String` module.

Strings are binaries:

```elixir
is_binary("cześć")
```

In UTF-8, 'ś' and 'ć' take two bytes each.

```elixir
# 💡 Try changing `byte_size` to `String.length/1`.
byte_size("cześć")
```

Using the String module:

```elixir
String.upcase("cześć")
```
