# Atoms and Comparison

## Atoms

An atom is a constant whose value is its own name. Some other languages call these symbols.

Atoms can be created using a preceding colon, like `:apple` or `:orange`. However, `true`, `false` and `nil` are also atoms - Elixir allows to skip the colon for them.

Other commonly used atoms are `:ok` and `:error`. They usually denote a success or a failure of some operation. For example, `IO.puts` always returns `:ok`.

Atoms with the same name are equal:

```elixir
:apple == :apple
```

Atoms with different names are not equal:

```elixir
:apple == :orange
```

Let's check if `true` is an atom:

```elixir
is_atom(true)
```

`true` and `:true` are the same:

```elixir
true == :true
```

`IO.puts` returns `:ok`:

```elixir
IO.puts("foo")
```

Now that we understand atoms, let's explore how to compare different values in Elixir.

## Structural comparison

Elixir also provides `==`, `!=`, `<=`, `>=`, `<` and `>` as comparison operators. We can compare numbers, atoms, strings, booleans, etc. Integers and floats compare the same if they have the same value, but you can use the strict comparison operator `===` and `!==` if you want to distinguish between integers and floats.

The comparison operators in Elixir can compare across any data type. It means you can, for example, compare strings with integers. It's useful in cases like sorting algorithms, but there are caveats - you can read more about it [here](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.html#module-structural-comparison).

Basic equality:

```elixir
1 == 1
```

Try changing `2.0` to `1.0`:

```elixir
1 == 2.0
```

String comparison - try changing "bar" to "foo":

```elixir
"foo" == "bar"
```

Strict equality distinguishes integers from floats - try changing `===` to `==`:

```elixir
1 === 1.0
```

Cross-type comparison - strings are greater than numbers:

```elixir
"abc" > 1
```

Atoms are greater than numbers - try changing the atom name:

```elixir
:infinity > 1
```
