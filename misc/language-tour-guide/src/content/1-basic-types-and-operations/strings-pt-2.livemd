# Strings

Strings in Elixir are represented internally by contiguous sequences of bytes, known as binaries. Thus, we can use functions such as `byte_size` on strings. Functions specific to strings are in the `String` module.

Strings are binaries:

```elixir
is_binary("cześć")
```

In UTF-8, 'ś' and 'ć' take two bytes each. Try changing `byte_size` to `String.length`:

```elixir
byte_size("cześć")
```

Using the String module:

```elixir
String.upcase("cześć")
```
