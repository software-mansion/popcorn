# Basic Arithmetic

Let's run the snippet and play with basic arithmetic operations. Notice, that `10 / 2` returned `5.0`. Division in Elixir always returns a float. For integer division, use `rem`. For float to integer conversion, you can use `round` or `trunc`. There are also `is_integer` and `is_float` to check the type of a number.

```elixir
IO.inspect 1 + 2, label: "sum 1 and 2"
IO.inspect 5 * 6, label: "multiply 5 by 6"
IO.inspect 10 / 2, label: "division"
IO.inspect div(10, 2), label: "integer division of 10 and 2"
IO.inspect rem(10, 3),
  label: "remainder of integer division of 10 and 3"

IO.inspect round(3.58), label: "round 3.58"

#ðŸ’¡ Let's change 'trunc' to 'ceil'. How does the result change?
IO.inspect trunc(3.58), label: "trunc 3.58"
```
