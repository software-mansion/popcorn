# Basic Arithmetic

Let's run the snippet and play with basic arithmetic operations. Notice, that `10 / 2` returned `5.0`. Division in Elixir always returns a float. For integer division, use `rem`. For float to integer conversion, you can use `round` or `trunc`. There are also `is_integer` and `is_float` to check the type of a number.

```elixir
IO.inspect 1 + 2, label: "sum 1 and 2"
IO.inspect 5 * 6, label: "multiply 5 by 6"
IO.inspect 10 / 2, label: :division
IO.inspect div(10, 2), label: "integer division of 10 and 2"
IO.inspect rem(10, 3), label: "remainder of integer division of 10 and 3"

# Let's change 'round' to 'trunc'. How does the result change?
IO.inspect round(3.58), label: "round 3.58"

# Let's try changing 'is_integer' to 'is_float'
IO.inspect is_integer(123), label: "is 123 an integer"
IO.inspect is_integer(4.5), label: "is 4.5 an integer"
```
