# Atoms

An atom is a constant whose value is its own name. Some other languages call these symbols.

Atoms can be created using a preceding colon, like `:apple` or `:orange`.

Atoms with the same name are equal:

```elixir
:apple == :apple
```

Atoms with different names are not equal:

```elixir
:apple == :orange
```

`true`, `false` and `nil` are also atoms - Elixir allows to skip the colon for them:

```elixir
# 💡 Try using `is_boolean` to check if atom `:false` is a boolean.
is_atom(true)
```

`true` and `:true` are the same:

```elixir
true == :true
```

Other commonly used atoms are `:ok` and `:error`. They usually denote a success or a failure of some operation. For example, `IO.puts/1` always returns `:ok`:

```elixir
IO.puts("foo")
```
