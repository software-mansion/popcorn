# Atoms

An atom is a constant whose value is its own name. Some other languages call these symbols.

Atoms can be created using a preceding colon, like `:apple` or `:orange`. However, `true`, `false` and `nil` are also atoms - Elixir allows to skip the colon for them.

Other commonly used atoms are `:ok` and `:error`. They usually denote a success or a failure of some operation. For example, `IO.puts` always returns `:ok`.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
IO.inspect :apple == :apple,
  label: "are atoms with the same name equal?"

IO.inspect :apple == :orange,
  label: "are atoms with different names equal?"

#ðŸ’¡ Let's use is_boolean to check if atom :false is a boolean.
IO.inspect is_atom(true), label: "is true an atom?"

IO.inspect true == :true, label: "are true and :true the same?"

IO.inspect IO.puts("foo"), label: "IO.puts returns"
```
