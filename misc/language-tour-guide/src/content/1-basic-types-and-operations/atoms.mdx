# Atoms

An atom is a constant whose value is its own name. Some other languages call these symbols.

`true`, `false` and `nil` are also atoms - Elixir allows to skip the colon for them.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
IO.inspect :apple == :apple, label: "atoms with the same name are equal"
IO.inspect :apple != :orange, label: "atoms with different names are distinct"

IO.inspect is_atom(true), label: "true is an atom"
IO.inspect is_boolean(:false), label: ":false is a boolean"
IO.inspect true == :true, label: "true and :true are the same"
```
