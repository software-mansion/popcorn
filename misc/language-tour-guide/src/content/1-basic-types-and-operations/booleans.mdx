# Booleans

Elixir supports `true` and `false` as booleans, and provides logical `and`, `or` and `not` operators to work on them.

Note that `and` and `or` are short-circuit: if the left-hand side determines the result, the right-hand side won't even be evaluated. It's especially important when doing side effects.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
IO.inspect true, label: "true"
IO.inspect false, label: "false"
IO.inspect true == false, label: "is true equal to false?"

IO.inspect true and true, label: "logical and of true and true"

#ðŸ’¡ Let's change 'true' to IO.inspect(true). Is "true" printed out?
IO.inspect false and true, label: "logical and of false and true"

IO.inspect false or is_boolean(true), label: "logical or of false and is_boolean(true)"

IO.inspect not true, label: "logical not of true"
```
