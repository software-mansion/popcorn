# Basic Types

In this chapter we will learn more about Elixir basic types: integers, floats, booleans, atoms, and strings. Let's see some examples.

Here's an integer:

```elixir
42
```

A float (decimal number):

```elixir
3.14159
```

A boolean value:

```elixir
true
```

An atom (a constant whose name is its value):

```elixir
:elixir
```

And a string:

```elixir
"Hello, Elixir!"
```
