# Variables and Immutability

In Elixir, all data is immutable. Variables are bound to values, not containers that can be mutated.

When you "change" a variable, you're actually rebinding it to a new value.

Variables follow snake_case convention and must start with a lowercase letter or underscore.

export const defaultCode = `# Binding a variable
x = 42
IO.puts("x is #{x}")

# Rebinding creates a new value

x = x + 1
IO.puts("x is now #{x}")

# Pattern matching with variables

{status, message} = {:ok, "Success!"}
IO.puts("Status: #{status}, Message: #{message}")

# The pin operator ^ matches existing values

y = 10
{^y, z} = {10, 20}
IO.puts("z is #{z}")`
