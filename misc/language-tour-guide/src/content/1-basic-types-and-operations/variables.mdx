# Variables and Immutability

Similarily to many other languages, you may define a new variable
by assigning a value to an identifier using `=` sign.

In Elixir, all data is immutable.
However, you may re-assign the variable name to a different value,
even of a different type.

Variables must start with a lowercase letter or an underscore.
By convention, the variable names are written in `snake_case`.
Leading underscore has a special meaning, but we'll get back to that later.

```elixir
x = "value"
IO.inspect(x, label: "x")

y = x
IO.inspect(y, label: "y")

x = :ok
IO.inspect(x, label: "new x")
IO.inspect(y, label: "y again")
```
