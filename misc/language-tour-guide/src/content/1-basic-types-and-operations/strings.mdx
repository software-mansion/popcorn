# Strings

Strings in Elixir are delimited by double quotes, and they are encoded in UTF-8. You can concatenate them with `<>` operator and interpolate with `#{}`. Interpolation works for all types that support conversion to string. Finally, `IO.puts` prints a string to the standard output.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
IO.inspect "Cześć", label: "UTF-8 string"
IO.inspect "hello" <> " " <> "world", label: "concat hello and world"
number = 42
IO.inspect "I am #{number} years old!", label: "string interpolation"

IO.puts("hello world")
```
