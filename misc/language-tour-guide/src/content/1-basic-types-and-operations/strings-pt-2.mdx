# Strings

Strings in Elixir are represented internally by contiguous sequences of bytes, known as binaries. Thus, we can use functions such as `byte_size` on strings. Functions specific to strings are in the `String` module.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
IO.inspect is_binary("cześć"), label: "string is a binary"

# Note that in UTF-8, 'ś' and 'ć' take two bytes each.
# Let's try changing 'byte_size' to 'String.length'
IO.inspect byte_size("cześć"), label: "cześć takes this many bytes"

IO.inspect String.upcase("cześć"), label: "upcase of cześć"
```
