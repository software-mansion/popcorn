# Strings

Strings in Elixir are represented internally by contiguous sequences of bytes, known as binaries. Thus, we can use functions such as `byte_size` on strings. Functions specific to strings are in the `String` module.

<EditorCode>
```elixir
IO.inspect is_binary("czeÅ›Ä‡"), label: "string is a binary"

# Note that in UTF-8, 'Å›' and 'Ä‡' take two bytes each.
#ðŸ’¡ Let's try changing 'byte_size' to 'String.length'
IO.inspect byte_size("czeÅ›Ä‡"), label: "czeÅ›Ä‡ takes this many bytes"

IO.inspect String.upcase("czeÅ›Ä‡"), label: "upcase of czeÅ›Ä‡"
```
