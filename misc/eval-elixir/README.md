# Elixir evaluation demo project

This project demonstrates using Popcorn JS package to embed Elixir evaluation on a webpage.

The project consists of two parts:

- JS part - Calls the Popcorn API and provides a simple landing.
- Elixir part - Accepts code evaluation requests using Popcorn's Elixir API, calls `Code.eval_string/3` and returns the result back. The only artifact generated by the Elixir part is the `bundle.avm` file, automatically copied into the `public` directory.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Elixir part of the project is built automatically.
