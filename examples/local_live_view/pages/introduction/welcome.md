# Welcome
LocalLiveView delivers local-first functionality by merging the powers of [Phoenix LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/welcome.html) with [Popcorn](https://hexdocs.pm/popcorn/readme.html).
## What is a LocalLiveView?
LocalLiveView is a project that aims to store the LiveView state in the browser in a virtual machine provided by Popcorn.
It allows to store, update and render the assigns similarly to Phoenix LiveView.
## Architecture
### Popcorn part
Local Live View is running on AtomVM in WASM in the browser using erlang virtual machine.
It is built as an elixir project with supervisor tree.

- `LocalLiveView.Application` starts `LocalLiveView.Dispatcher` and `LocalLiveView.Server.Supervisor`.
- `LocalLiveView.Dispatcher` is an entry point for Popcorn to handle the wasm messages. 
On start, it receives all names of LocalLiveViews present on the page and for each view it creates a `LocalLiveView.Server` process.
- `LocalLiveView.Server.Supervisor` is a dynamic supervisor that is used by `LocalLiveView.Dispatcher`
to create `LocalLiveView.Server` processes dynamically.
- `LocalLiveView.Dispatcher` handles wasm messages that contains phoenix events by dispatching it to 
a correct `LocalLiveView.Server` process.
- `LocalLiveView.Server` handles the phoenix events and rerenders the LocalLiveView if needed.
- `LocalLiveView.Renderer` is used by `LocalLiveView.Server` to rerender LocalLiveView.
It is done by replaceing innerHTML of div marked as a LocalLiveView (the div must have 
`data-pop-view="ExampleViewLocal"` attribute) with new HTML body generated by phoenix part of the code.
- All the files in `lib/necessary_phoenix` directory are copies of the phoenix framework code.
It is used to generate new HTML body for LocalLiveView that will be rendered into the marked div.
- `LocalLiveView.Server` stores the state (socket and assigns) of the LocalLiveView.
It fills similar role to the phoenix's channel in Phoenix Live View.

### JS part

- LocalLiveView JS functionality is implemented in `priv/static/local_live_view.js`.
- It is responsible for sending initial request to LocalLiveView.Dispatcher to create all LocalLiveViews 
present on the page using `popcorn.call()`.
- It also sends registered events to LocalLiveView.Server also using `popcorn.call()`.
- Events are registered on the page by adding `addEventListener` function to the element with 
"pop-\<event\>" attribute where \<event\> is a browser event (`click`, `change`, `input` etc.).
- When the event listener is added to the element with "pop-event" attribute 
the closest LocalLiveView is found by checking every ancestor if it is marked with `data-pop-view` attribute.
That way when the event is triggered the phoenix event sent via `popcorn.call()` gets to correct `LocalLiveView.Server`.
