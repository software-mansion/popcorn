**Popcorn is a library that allows you to run client-side Elixir in browsers, with JavaScript interoperability**

Popcorn is early stages and may break. Please report an issue if it does. Contributions are very welcome, but please open an issue before committing too much effort.

Under the hood, Popcorn runs [AtomVM](https://github.com/atomvm/AtomVM), a tiny Erlang VM.

## Examples

The examples are hosted at [popcorn.swmansion.com](https://popcorn.swmansion.com), and the source code is in the `examples` directory.

## Getting started

*Note: Popcorn currently only works OTP 26.0.2 and Elixir 1.17.3. We're working to lift this requirement.*

Popcorn requires just a few short steps to setup. Firstly, add the project to dependencies and ensure you have an application start callback:

```elixir
# mix.exs

def application do
  [
    extra_applications: [],
    mod: {MyApp.Application, []}
  ]
end

def deps do
  [
    {:popcorn, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

The application should start a worker process:

```elixir
# lib/my_app/application.ex
defmodule MyApp.Application do
  use Application

  @impl true
  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      MyApp.Worker
    ]

    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end
end
```

A minimal worker should register itself using `Popcorn.Wasm.register/1`:

```elixir
# lib/my_app/worker.ex

defmodule MyApp.Worker do
  use GenServer

  @process_name :main

  def start_link(args) do
    GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, args, name: @process_name)
  end

  @impl true
  def init(_init_arg) do
    Popcorn.Wasm.register(@process_name)
    IO.puts("Hello from WASM!")
    state = %{}
    {:ok, state}
  end
end
```

Then, configure the directory to output static artifacts:

```elixir
# config/config.exs
import Config
config :popcorn, out_dir: "static/wasm"
```

Finally, run `mix deps.get` and `mix popcorn.cook`. The latter will generate WASM artifacts in the `static/wasm` directory. Add a simple HTML file that will load it:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<html>
  <script type="module">
      import { Popcorn } from "./wasm/popcorn.js";
      await Popcorn.init({ onStdout: console.log });
  </script>
  <body></body>
</html>
 ```

The easiest way to host the page is to generate a simple HTTP server script with `mix popcorn.simple_server` and run it with `elixir server.exs`. Then, at <http://localhost:4000>, you should see `Hello from WASM` printed in the console.

The webpage can also be hosted with any HTTP static file server, but **it must add the following HTTP headers**:

```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

Otherwise, browsers refuse to run WASM.

### Live reloading

Popcorn also ships with a server that supports live reloading. It can be generated with `mix popcorn.dev_server` and run with `elixir dev_server.exs`.

The index.html requires an extra line to load the required JavaScript.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<html>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="/dev_server.js"></script>
  <script type="module">
      import { Popcorn } from "./wasm/popcorn.js";
      await Popcorn.init({ onStdout: console.log });
  </script>
  <body></body>
</html>
 ```

## Configuration of the runtime

Popcorn runs AtomVM under the hood, and therefore it needs to either download precompied artifacts or compile it from source. The default configuration should work out of the box, but you can change it to use a different version of AtomVM.

Precompiled artifacts are downloaded during Popcorn compilation, from the source specified with `runtime` config key, for example:

```elixir
config :popcorn, runtime: [
  {:url, "https://atomvm/wasm/url", target: :wasm},
  {:path, "/path/to/atomvm/unix", target: :unix}
]
```

If you want to build the runtime from source, run `mix popcorn.build_runtime --target <unix|wasm>`. Make sure you have [AtomVM dependencies](https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm?tab=readme-ov-file#dependencies) installed. Then, configure the runtime as follows:

```elixir
config :popcorn, runtime: {:path, "popcorn_runtime_source/artifacts/$target"}
```

## Development

We use [`mise`](https://mise.jdx.dev) to manage dependencies. [Install it](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html) and install deps and dev tools with:

```shell
mise install
```

Then, you should setup pre-commit hooks using [lefthook](https://lefthook.dev):

```shell
lefthook install
```

### Testing

Popcorn tests can be run either on WASM via Playwright or natively on UNIX. To run them on WASM, run

```shell
TARGET=wasm mix test
```

To run tests on UNIX, use

```shell
mix popcorn.build_runtime --target unix
```

to build AtomVM from source. Make sure you have [AtomVM dependencies](https://github.com/atomvm/atomvm?tab=readme-ov-file#dependencies) installed. Then, run

```shell
mix test
```
