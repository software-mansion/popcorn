% Patch reason: the last clause of do_call uses erlang:monitor/3
% which requires process aliases, not avaliable in AtomVM.
% Without it, if the calling process traps exits, there's RC and reply
% messages that arrived after the timeout may pollute its mailbox.
%
% Patch reason: the last clause uses erlang:send/3, not available
% in AtomVM. Since it only matters in distribution, which is not
% supported anyway, it's safe to change it to a regular send.
